/*
Given a 2d matrix of 1s (land) and 0s (swimming pools), write an algorithm that counts the number of swimming pools. A swimming pool can be classified as a group of 0s that connect either vertically or horizontally (diagonal 0s don't connect).

Example:
[
  [1,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1]
]
return 2

Example:
[
  [0,1,1,0],
  [1,0,0,1],
  [1,1,1,0],
  [1,0,0,0]
]
return 4
