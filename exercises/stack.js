/*

Create a Stack class WITHOUT implementing any JavaScript array methods (Array.push, Array.pop, etc).

The stack should have the following methods:
push - adds an item to the top of the Stack
pop - removes the top item from the Stack
peek - tells us what value was last added to the Stack
getSize - tells us how many values are currently in the stack
reset - removes all elements from the stack

 */

class Stack {
  constructor() {

export default Stack;
